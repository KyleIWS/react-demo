# react-demo
TO INSTALL REACT DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. Start by pulling master from this repo. Delete index.html, and index.js
2. Install NPM.
3. Go to the root directory (react-demo in this case)
4. Open a terminal/bash window there. Type: npm -g install create-react-app
5. Now type: create-react-app 
-- (This step varies from computer to computer depending on the set-up of your filesystem. 
-- You may have to go search for the program that was installed with the command above.
-- It is called "create-react-app". You need to find it and use it in our directory.)
-- For extra help, Google or the docs: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app#getting-started
-- The command you should run is: create-react-app tictactoe
-- This may take over 10 minutes.
6. You now have a basic react app that you can edit, in the tictactoe folder.

To run the page, go into the created directory "tictactoe" in the shell and type npm start. After that, the url: localhost:3000 will be hosting the app.

This directory contains the empty react shell. The other branches will have the features. This branching structure is more for my sake, so I can go back to different stages of development more easily.
